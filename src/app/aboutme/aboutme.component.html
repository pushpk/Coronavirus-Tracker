  Hi, I am Pushpak Panchal. I am a full stack web developer at a Chicago Based Law-firm.

  I have built this website to help people track the current and a close-to-realtime status of the corona virus outbreak across the globe.
  
  It all started with a thought about building something for fun, which inturn should also be helpful for people.
  
  It took me less then a week to code this project and push it to a production server.
  
  Thanks to following tools & hosting websites which helped me build the site without paying a single penny.
  
  Angular 8 + PWA
  Web API Services
  Azure to Host Web API Services
  Zeit.co to setup hosting + .now.sh domain and a CI/CD pipeline.
  GitHub for version control.
